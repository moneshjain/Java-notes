
* What is a Programming Language?

		A programming language is a special language used to give instructions to a computer.
		Just like humans understand Hindi or English,
		computers understand only 0s and 1s (binary).
		But writing everything in 0s and 1s is very difficult.
		So we use programming languages (like C, Java, Python, JavaScript) to write instructions in a simple, human-readable way.
		The computer then converts these instructions into machine code (0s & 1s) and executes them.

		Low-Level Languages (Machine Level)
			These languages are closest to the computer hardware.
			They are fast but difficult for humans to understand.
		
		High-Level Languages
			Easy for humans to read and write.
			They are converted into machine code using compiler or interpreter.
			
		Procedural Languages (Structured Programming)
			These languages follow a step-by-step approach.
			Program = set of procedures/functions.
		
		Object-Oriented Programming (OOP Languages)
			Based on objects + classes.
			Useful for large applications.
			
		Functional Programming Languages
			Based on mathematical functions.
			Focus on what to do, not how to do.
			jaise ki java script me hota hai fuctions ka use karte hai 
			
		Markup Languages
			Used to define structure and formatting, not logic.	
			like HTML, XML, JSON
			
		Database Query Languages
			Used for interacting with databases.	
			
			
1. Static Language (Statically Typed Language)

		A static language is a language where type checking happens at compile time.

		✔ Key Features:

			Variables must have a fixed type
			Type is known before running the program
			Type errors are caught during compilation
			Faster execution (because types are known early)
			More memory-efficient
			Requires explicit type declaration (mostly)

		✔ Example Languages:
			Java
			C, C++, Rust, Go
			Kotlin, Swift
		✔ Example in Java:
			int num = 10;    // type fixed as int
			num = "hello";   // ❌ Compile-time error
			
2. Dynamic Language (Dynamically Typed Language)

		A dynamic language is a language where type checking happens at runtime.

		✔ Key Features:
		Variable type is decided at runtime
		Type can change anytime
		Flexible and quick to write
		Errors appear while running the program
		Slower than static languages (because of runtime decisions)

		✔ Example Languages:
			Python
			JavaScript
			Ruby
			PHP
		✔ Example in Python:
			x = 10     # x is int
			x = "Hi"   # valid — x becomes string

What is Java?

	Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (1995).

	Key Features
		Platform Independent – Write Once Run Anywhere
		Object-Oriented – Everything is based on real-world objects
		Robust & Secure – Automatic memory management, bytecode verification
		Multithreaded – Can run multiple tasks simultaneously
		Portable – Same program works on all OS
		High Performance – Uses Just-In-Time compiler
		Distributed – Supports RMI, Web services
	Why Java is Still Relevant Today
		Android apps
		Banking software
		Trading applications
		Enterprise Backend systems
		Cloud, Microservices, Spring Boot
		
		
	🔹 1. Compiler (javac)

		A compiler converts Java source code (.java) into bytecode (.class).
		✔ What it does:
		Checks syntax
		Reports errors
		Converts human-readable code → bytecode
		✔ Example:
		javac MyProgram.java
		Output: MyProgram.class (bytecode)

	🔹 2. Interpreter

		JVM has an internal interpreter that executes bytecode line by line.
		✔ What it does:
		Reads each bytecode instruction
		Executes it one by one
		Makes Java platform independent

	🔹 3. JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler)

		JIT is part of the JVM.
		It improves performance by converting frequently used bytecode into native machine code.

		✔ Why JIT?
			Interpretation is slow
			JIT compiles hot code paths → fast execution
		✔ How JIT works:
			JVM interprets code normally
			If a method runs many times, JIT marks it as “hot”
			Converts that method into machine code
			Next time, JVM runs machine code directly → faster!

	🔹 4. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

		JVM is a virtual computer that runs Java bytecode.

		✔ What JVM does:
		Loads bytecode
		Verifies bytecode (security)
		Executes bytecode
		Provides memory management (Heap, Stack)
		Performs Garbage Collection
		✔ JVM = Brain of Java
		Java is platform-independent because bytecode runs on JVM, and JVM is available for every OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).

	🔹 5. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

		JRE provides everything needed to run a Java program.

		✔ JRE contains:

		JVM
		Core libraries (java., javax.)
		Supporting files
		✔ JRE does NOT contain:
		Compiler
		Development tools
		✔ Use case:
		If you only want to run a Java program → install JRE.
		
	🔹 6. JDK (Java Development Kit)

		JDK is the complete package for developing Java applications.
		✔ JDK contains:
		JRE
		JVM
		Libraries
		Compiler (javac)
		Tools (javadoc, jdb, jar)
		✔ Use case:
		If you want to write + compile + run Java → install JDK.


1. Stack Memory (Fast, Temporary Memory)

	Stack memory stores:
		Local variables
		Method parameters
		Function call information
		Primitive data types
		References to objects (not the objects themselves)

	✔ Key Features:
		Very fast
		Last In First Out (LIFO) structure
		Memory is freed automatically when method ends
		Small size compared to heap
		
		void test() {
			int x = 10;  // stored in stack
			int y = 20;  // stored in stack
		}


2. Heap Memory (Large, Dynamic Memory)

	Heap memory stores:

		Objects
		Arrays
		Instance variables
		All objects created using new
		
	✔ Key Features:

		Large memory area
		Slower access than stack
		Shared across all threads
		Managed by Garbage Collector

	✔ Example:
		Car c = new Car();
		
		c → stored in stack
		Actual object → stored in heap
		
3. Garbage Collector (GC)

	Garbage Collector is a JVM component that automatically removes unused objects from heap memory.
	✔ When does GC clean objects?
		GC removes an object when:
		❌ No reference is pointing to it
		OR
		❌ Object becomes unreachable

	✔ Example:
		Car c = new Car();
		c = null;    // object in heap becomes unreachable
		
	Now GC can delete the object.

				
	Primitive Data Types
	Primitive data types are the basic, fundamental data types built into Java.
		Types of Primitive Data Types (8)
		Type	Example		Size		Description
		byte	10			1 byte		Small integer
		short	100			2 bytes		Medium integer
		int		1000		4 bytes		Common integer
		long	10000L		8 bytes		Large integer
		float	10.5f		4 bytes		Decimal number
		double	20.55		8 bytes		Larger decimal number
		char	'A'			2 bytes		Single character
		boolean	true/false	1 bit		Logical value	
	Non-Primitive Data Types
		Non-primitive data types are created by the programmer or are class-based types.
		Types of Non-Primitive Data Types
		String
		Arrays
		Classes
		Objects
		Interfaces
